I purchased this laptop two weeks ago and I'm truly impressed by the battery life and vibrant screen quality. However, the keyboard feels flimsy and the touchpad isn't very responsive, which can be frustrating during extended use. Overall, a decent device for everyday tasks but could use hardware improvements.
This smartphone has an outstanding camera, battery that lasts all day, and smooth performance. The user interface is intuitive and fast, but I was disappointed that it doesn't include a headphone jack. Otherwise, it's a great value for its price point.
